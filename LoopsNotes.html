//You can use map() to do something to each item in a collection and create a new collection containing the changed items:

const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);
console.log(map1); // expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]

//more .map(), here using built in functions
//.map(function) takes the inputs as function inputs
const numbers = [1, 4, 9, 25];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = numbers.map(Math.sqrt); //1,2,3,5


//You can use filter() to test each item in a collection, and create a new collection containing only items that match:
//constName.filter(functionBooleanT/F)
//if function is TRUE, the element is included
//else, delete the element

//Launch Countdown
//see LoopNotes_Countdown.html for the full code
//README
//Active learning: Launch countdown
//In this exercise, we want you to print out a simple launch countdown to the output box, from 10 down to Blastoff. Specifically, we want you to:
//
//Loop from 10 down to 0. We've provided you with an initializer — let i = 10;.
//For each iteration, create a new paragraph and append it to the output <div>, which we've selected using const output = document.querySelector('.output');. In comments, we've provided you with three code lines that need to be used somewhere inside the loop:
//const para = document.createElement('p'); — creates a new paragraph.
//output.appendChild(para); — appends the paragraph to the output <div>.
//para.textContent = — makes the text inside the paragraph equal to whatever you put on the right-hand side, after the equals sign.
//Different iteration numbers require different text to be put in the paragraph for that iteration (you'll need a conditional statement and multiple para.textContent = lines):
//If the number is 10, print "Countdown 10" to the paragraph.
//If the number is 0, print "Blast off!" to the paragraph.
//For any other number, print just the number to the paragraph.
//Remember to include an iterator! However, in this example we are counting down after each iteration, not up, so you don't want i++ — how do you iterate downwards?
//continue Countdown, just need to test the para method separately then add --DONE

//GuestList
//LoopNotes_GuestList.html
//Active learning: Filling in a guest list
//In this exercise, we want you to take a list of names stored in an array and put them into a guest list. But it's not quite that easy — we don't want to let Phil and Lola in because they are greedy and rude, and always eat all the food! We have two lists, one for guests to admit, and one for guests to refuse.
//
//Specifically, we want you to:
//
//Write a loop that will iterate through the people array.
//During each loop iteration, check if the current array item is equal to "Phil" or "Lola" using a conditional statement:
//If it is, concatenate the array item to the end of the refused paragraph's textContent, followed by a comma and a space.
//If it isn't, concatenate the array item to the end of the admitted paragraph's textContent, followed by a comma and a space.
//We've already provided you with:
//
//refused.textContent += — the beginnings of a line that will concatenate something on to the end of refused.textContent.
//admitted.textContent += — the beginnings of a line that will concatenate something on to the end of admitted.textContent.
//Extra bonus question — after completing the above tasks successfully, you will be left with two lists of names, separated by commas, but they will be untidy — there will be a comma at the end of each one. Can you work out how to write lines that slice the last comma off in each case, and add a full stop to the end? Have a look at the Useful string methods article for help.

//Which loop type should you use?
//First for...of:
//for (const item of array) {
//  // code to run
//}
//
//for:
//for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
//  // code to run
//}


//If the loop body has a single statement, we can omit the curly braces {…}:
let i = 3;
while (i) alert(i--);

//The “do…while” loop
//The condition check can be moved below the loop body using the do..while syntax:
do {
  // loop body
} while (condition);
let i = 0;
do {
  alert( i );
  i++;
} while (i < 3);


//A label is an identifier with a colon before a loop:
labelName: for (...) {
  ...
}
outer: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {

  let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, '');

  // if an empty string or canceled, then break out of both loops
  if (!input) break outer; // (*)

  // do something with the value...
}
}
alert('Done!');

//In the code above, break outer looks upwards for the label named outer and breaks out of that loop.
//So the control goes straight from (*) to alert('Done!').
//We can also move the label onto a separate line:


//what is the last output?
let i = 3;
while (i) {
  alert( i-- );
}
//last is 1 because at 0 == false

//Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10.
for (let i=2; i<=10; i += 2) {
  alert(i);
}
//cant use i==10 because 2-8 will be false
//alternatively
for (let i = 2; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    alert( i );
  }
}


//Rewrite the code changing the for loop to while without altering its behavior (the output should stay same).
//alerts from 0 to 2
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  alert( `number ${i}!` );
};
//solution
let i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
  alert( `number ${i}!` );
  i++;
};


//Repeat until the input is correct
//Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.
//
//The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
//
//Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.
let i = 0;
while(i<=100) {
  i = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100");
};//declared i as zero just to define its type//no need for increments
//while i is not greater than 100, user can redefine i
//alternative answer with string check
let num;

do {
  num = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100?", 0);
} while (num <= 100 && num);
//The loop do..while repeats while both checks are truthy:
//
//The check for num <= 100 – that is, the entered value is still not greater than 100.
//The check && num is false when num is null or an empty string. Then the while loop stops too.
//P.S. If num is null then num <= 100 is true, so without the 2nd check the loop wouldn’t stop if the user clicks CANCEL. Both checks are required.


//Output prime numbers
//importance: 3
//An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.
//
//In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
//
//For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
//
//Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.
//
//For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
//
//P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.

//--my solution-- (see /home/rico/the-odin-project/js-exercises/js-rock-paper-scissors/LoopNotes_PrimeNumberEnumerator.html)
//alternative
let n = 10;

nextPrime:
for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) { // for each i...

  for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) { // look for a divisor..
    if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime; // not a prime, go next i
  }

  alert( i ); // a prime
}
